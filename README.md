In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use TensorFlow to build and train a neural network to approximate the function $f(x) = x^2 \cdot e^{-x^2}$. This will help you understand the fundamental concepts and workings of neural networks, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and the training process.

We will start by defining the neural network model, followed by preparing and scaling the data, training the model, and visualizing the results. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to use TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate neural networks for function approximation.
